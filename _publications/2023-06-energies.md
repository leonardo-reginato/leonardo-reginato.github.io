This paper explores the application of Hybrid Machine Learning (HML) to model and optimize relative permeability changes under Engineered Water Injection (EWI) in carbonate reservoirs. The HML approach integrates K-Means clustering for wettability classification and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for permeability predictions. It offers a cost-effective and accurate alternative to conventional geochemical simulations. The methodology involved developing a robust database using synthetic reservoir models, incorporating variability in salinity and mineralogy. The HML approach first classified permeability profiles into three wettability groups (oil-wet, water-wet, intermediate) using K-Means. Subsequently, tailored ANNs predicted permeability changes for each group. Grid Search Cross Validation optimized ANN hyperparameters, achieving high predictive accuracy with R² values up to 0.929. The optimized HML pipeline was applied to a case study benchmark. Results showed EWI increased oil recovery by 7.3% and reduced water injection and production by 28.5% and 40.5%, respectively, compared to standard waterflooding. Despite a 25% higher injection cost for EWI, the Net Present Value (NPV) rose by 45.3%, highlighting the method’s economic viability. Key innovations include leveraging clustering and tailored neural networks to capture nuanced reservoir behaviors, achieving greater modeling accuracy while simplifying complex geochemical processes. This study underscores HML’s potential to enhance production strategies in petroleum engineering, offering scalable and efficient tools for optimizing advanced recovery methods in diverse reservoir conditions.
