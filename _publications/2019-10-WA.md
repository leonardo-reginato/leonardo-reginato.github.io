title: "Prediction of wettability alteration using the artificial neural networks in the salinity control of water injection in carbonate reservoirs"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2019-10-WA
excerpt: 'This study leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to model the impact of ionic composition on wettability alteration in carbonate reservoirs during Engineered Water Injection (EWI). By optimizing injection parameters for a Brazilian Pre-Salt benchmark, EWI was shown to enhance oil recovery by 8.7% and reduce water production by 52%, significantly improving field profitability compared to standard methods.'
