excerpt: 'This paper introduces a Hybrid Machine Learning (HML) solution combining K-Means and Artificial Neural Networks to predict petrophysical behaviors during Engineered Water Injection (EWI). The study demonstrates the effectiveness of HML in optimizing oil production, achieving a 7.3% increase in output while significantly reducing water injection and production costs by 28% and 40%, respectively. Additionally, the proposed approach enhances modeling accuracy and efficiency for advanced production methods, even under higher injection costs, highlighting its potential for improving profitability in both new and mature oil fields.'
