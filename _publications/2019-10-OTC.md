This paper explores the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict wettability alterations resulting from salinity-controlled water injection in carbonate reservoirs, a process critical for enhancing oil recovery. The study integrates two ANN approaches—Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Neural Net Fitting (NNF)—to forecast relative permeability curves influenced by ionic composition changes. The methodology involves developing an analytical algorithm to simulate wettability alteration effects by recalibrating relative permeability curves based on varying salinity levels. Using synthetic reservoir models, a robust dataset was generated for ANN training. SOM, an unsupervised learning approach, organized data into topological maps to identify input-output relationships, while NNF, a supervised technique, used backpropagation to refine predictions. The key innovation lies in replacing costly and time-consuming laboratory tests with ANN-based predictive models. Results showed that NNF achieved higher accuracy, with R-squared values exceeding 90%, compared to SOM’s 88%. The SOM network, despite lower precision, provided valuable insights into variable interactions via heat plots. Both methods highlighted significant effects of salinity control, such as increased oil permeability and reduced water permeability, confirming wettability alteration’s role in improved oil recovery. This work demonstrates the potential of ANNs to efficiently model complex reservoir behaviors, offering a cost-effective and scalable alternative for optimizing enhanced oil recovery strategies in carbonate reservoirs. The findings pave the way for broader implementation of machine learning techniques in petroleum engineering.
