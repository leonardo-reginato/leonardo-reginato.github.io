I’m currently a Research Tech at *The University of Texas at Austin*, blending my engineering roots with a passion for AI and Machine Learning . Originally trained as a Petroleum Engineer 🛢️, I shifted gears over the years towards the exciting world of data science and AI. I was lucky enough to spend about 3 years as a Machine Learning Engineer at a tech company in Brazil 🇧🇷, where I honed my skills.

Now, I’m diving deep into AI, with a focus on Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Large Language Models. My latest challenge? Applying AI to solve a Fish Image Classification problem 🐟 — and I’m loving every bit of it!
