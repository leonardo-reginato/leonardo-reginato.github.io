Welcome! I am a researcher and engineer specializing in leveraging machine learning to address challenges in energy, environmental science, and data-driven engineering. Currently, I am a Research Technician at the University of Texas at Austin 🤘🏼, where I develop deep learning models for ecological applications (🐠+📷+🤖), exploring interdisciplinary solutions that merge AI and marine science.

I hold an M.S. in Mines and Petroleum Engineering from the University of São Paulo and a B.S. in Petroleum Engineering from the Catholic University of Santos. My research spans applications of hybrid machine learning in energy production, optimization of injection techniques in oil reservoirs, and conservation-focused AI modeling. My work has been published in journals like Energies and Oil & Gas Science and Technology.

Beyond research, I have professional experience as a machine learning engineer, where I applied AI solutions across industries, enhancing operational efficiency and scalability. My long-term goal is to continue innovating at the intersection of AI and engineering to drive sustainable solutions for global challenges.
