Hi there! I’m Leonardo Reginato — a researcher and engineer who loves harnessing the power of AI to solve complex problems. Currently, I’m a Research Technician at the University of Texas at Austin 🤘🏼, where I’m diving deep into developing cutting-edge deep learning models for ecological challenges 🐟📷🤖, blending computer vision and marine science to create impactful solutions.

My academic roots are in Petroleum Engineering 🛢️, with an M.S. from the University of São Paulo and a B.S. from the Catholic University of Santos. While my early career focused on energy research and hybrid machine learning for oil recovery, I later transitioned into the exciting world of data science and AI 🌐. Over the years, I’ve worked on diverse projects like credit card fraud detection, customer segmentation, and image classification, always striving to make data actionable and impactful 💡.

These days, my main focus is on Large Language Models (LLMs) 🤖📚 and multimodal AI 🖼️🔤🔊, exploring how to integrate multiple data sources to unlock innovative applications. I’m passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI to tackle interdisciplinary challenges and create scalable, sustainable solutions.

With a strong skill set in Python 🐍, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and cloud platforms like AWS ☁️, I thrive at the intersection of machine learning, engineering, and real-world impact. Whether it’s enhancing operational efficiency or developing ecological AI tools, I’m always excited to learn and innovate.

When I’m not working, I love geeking out over the latest advancements in AI or brainstorming new ideas with collaborators 🤝. Let’s connect if you want to chat about tech, science, or the future of AI 🚀!
